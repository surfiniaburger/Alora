# Alora Project Roadmap

## Upcoming Features & Refactoring

### Architecture & AI Integration
- [ ] **Unified Persona Architecture**: Transitioning from context-switching multiple personas to a single, coherent persona that adapts to the current mode (EV vs. Race).
- [ ] **Object Classification with Meta SAM2**: Integrating Meta's Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for advanced object detection and classification capabilities.
    - *Note*: As an open-source model, this will require a hosting strategy (e.g., self-hosted, cloud inference API).
