    # NOTE: To produce a signed .ipa for the App Store (or TestFlight), you must configure signing.
    # This example builds an unsigned archive for verification. 
    # To sign, you need to import your distribution certificate and provisioning profile.
    # See: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/deploying-xcode-applications/installing-an-apple-certificate-on-macos-runners-for-xcode-development
